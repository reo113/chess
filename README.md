# Chess Game with JavaFX

# NOTE This project is not fully compete missing the appropriate check and checkmate functionality. 

This project is an implementation of a chess game using JavaFX. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for playing chess against another human player. The game follows the standard rules of chess and includes features such as move validation, checkmate detection

## Project Structure

As discussed on Blackboard, your group project is to design a simple 2D grid-based game using the Java programming language and JavaFX.  Although the assignment is vague, I will require the following from all of you in order for your group to receive top credit:

1)	At least one abstract class and one interface: It is not enough that your game “works” – you must show that you understand the tenets of object-oriented design!  The size of these items is not important; it is the design that is of utmost importance, because you also must demonstrate…
2)	Polymorphism: Have your code be as flexible as possible.  For example, can your game easily incorporate a smarter computer player without having to rewrite large blocks of code?
3)	Work Log: This is 40% of the group project, and each grade is on an individual basis.  How much work did each person give to the project each day?  It should be a daily representation of everyone’s work.  Normally, this would be printed out and bound as professionally as possible, but we don’t have that luxury this semester.  I will just need this all submitted to me as one large Microsoft Word file.  I really need to know what each member is doing daily, since there will not be labs for the last few weeks of class.
4)	Design Approach Explanation: This should be a 2-3 page document explaining your design process.  Which process did your group choose (waterfall model, iterative model, V-shaped, etc.) and how did it evolve as your project formed?
5)	UML Diagram: All of your classes, as well as their relationships, need to be shown in a UML diagram.
6)	Java Docs: I need a Java Doc for each of your classes!  Make sure you have followed Java Doc commenting conventions!
7)	Code: I will need all of your source code, as well as an executable jar file that can be run on any computer.  I will show you how to create the jar file as we draw nearer to presentation day.

The breakdown for the group project grade is the following:
	
	Work Log: 40%
	Development Approach: 10%
	UML Diagram: 20%
	Java Docs: 10%
Code:  20%

	Presentations will take place (tentatively) on Thursday, December 8. Everyone should be prepared to present for a minimum of eight minutes and a maximum of fifteen minutes.
The main objectives of this chess game project are:

## Project Overview

1. Game Logic: Implement the rules and logic of chess, including valid moves for each chess piece, checkmate detection, and handling special moves such as promotion.

2. Graphical User Interface: Design and develop a user-friendly GUI using JavaFX to provide a visually appealing and interactive chess game experience. The GUI should allow players to select pieces, make moves, display captured pieces, and show current game status.

3. Player Modes: Support two-player modes.

4.~~ Game State Management: Implement game state management to handle saving and loading of game progress, allowing players to resume or restart games at a later time.~~

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JavaFX

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- JavaFX libraries

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the JDK and JavaFX properly installed on your system.

3. Build the project using a Java build tool or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports JavaFX.

4. Run the compiled application to start the chess game.

5. Use the mouse to select and move chess pieces on the board.

6. Play the game following the standard rules of chess.
